# Enron_fraud_POI_identifier
Machine learning based project on the Enron database to identify 'persons of interest'

In 2001 Enron was one of the biggest companies in the US. However, in 2002 it declared bankrupcy due to fraud
committed by a few people in the management. The federal investigators hunted down these people and they
have been scrutinized. These are the people we will refer to as 'persons of Interest' or 'POI' in this document. A
large amount, otherwise confidential, company data have been made public at this time.
The purpose of this machine learning project is to identify such POIs based on the publicly available information.
We are trying to build a model that will be trained with the help of the available data and subsequently used to
predict if any preson is a POI or not.
